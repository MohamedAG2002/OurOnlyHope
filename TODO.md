# To fix
- Abandon camera?

- The rotations aren't great with joystick controls as the player does reset his rotations when the left analog has been let go. The player should instead remember his last rotaion and continue from there rather than resetting every time the player lets go of the analog, which can be annoying. 

- The zombie sounds get sampled together which create an ear-raping symphony. FIX THAT!

- Make the pause key the ESC key and not the P key

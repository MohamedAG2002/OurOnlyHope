# Engine
- Animation
- Particle sytem 
- Embed in the web using Emscripten

# Game
- Add joystick controls?
- Add camera?
- Easter Egg

# Polish
- Make the game pause when the window is out of focus
- Better weapons: better roations, better attack pattern
- Reword the values of the items maybe?
- Get better assets i.e sprites, sounds, tiles
- Polish up the killing of the zombies
- Polish up the transition from the game to the shop scene. Don't make it abrupt
- Fade into the menu scene

# Problems to fix 
- The zombies' grunts sample together and it sounds like a demon orgy

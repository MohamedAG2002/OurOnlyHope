# Engine
- Animation
- Particle sytem 

# Game
- Find a better way to add descriptions to the item frames
- Implement the spear
- Easter Egg
- Embed in the web using Emscripten

# Polish
- Make the game pause when the window is out of focus
- Better weapons: better roations, better attack pattern
- Reword the values of the items maybe?
- Get better assets i.e sprites, sounds, tiles
- Polish up the killing of the zombies
- Polish up the transition from the game to the shop scene. Don't make it abrupt
- Fade into the menu scene

# Problems to fix 
- The buttons in the shop scene are not centered
- The wave counter in the shop scene reads a bunch of garbage from the file. Maybe have two different .dat files instead of 1?
- The zombies' grunts sample together and it sounds like a demon orgy
- The player still goes out of bounds
- Make the ESC the pause key instead of P?

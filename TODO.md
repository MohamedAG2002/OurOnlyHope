# Engine
- Embed in the web using Emscripten

# Game
- Sliders for the volume settings
- Easter Egg

# Polish
- Over scene
- Player sprite animation
- Polish up the transition from the game to the shop scene. Don't make it abrupt
- Fade into the menu scene
- FUCKIN PLAY TEST IT!
- Redo the values of the items maybe?

# Problems to fix
- Do you need an over win scene?
- If the player picks the spear, the naked armor, and the dextirity potion, they will be wizzing across the screen which is bad.
- The zombies' grunts sample together and it sounds like a demon orgy

# Engine
- Embed in the web using Emscripten

# Game
- Easter Egg

# Polish
- Remove the armor and weapon selection. Just have a spear as the only option and make the player choose only the potions after each wave
- Replace the spear throw sound. It's terrible!
- Over scene
- Player sprite animation
- Polish up the transition from the game to the shop scene. Don't make it abrupt
- Fade into the menu scene
- FUCKIN PLAY TEST IT!
- Redo the values of the items maybe?

# Problems to fix
- The zombies' grunts sample together and it sounds like a demon orgy

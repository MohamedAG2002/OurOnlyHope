# Problems to fix 
- When the player finishes a wave and goes to the shop scene, make sure to keep the current wave counter. Instead, it resets which is not what's supposed to happen
- The zombies' grunts sample together and it sounds like a demon orgy
- The player still goes out of bounds
- Make the ESC the pause key instead of P?
